Continous deployment process.

There are various approaches to design the deployent process, two of them are:

1. Using CI/CD tool like Gitlab CI/CD and running kubectl commands to deploy the application

2. Using Gitops Method with tools like Flux to maanage the k8s file and deploy them automatically on to the K8s clusters.

Using CI/CD tool like Gitlab.

So the Process in our task start with the Building the Docker Image.
I am assuming we are already doing the CI process which would include code check, code compile and package, may be unit testing and creating artifacts out of it.

1.1 So once the integration process is completed,
we can define rules in our pipeline to use the Dockerfile in the repository and build the docker image of it.

1.2 To Make deployments flexible, we can use Helm chart of our flask application,
helm charts consists of template files, values and Chart.yml files, in which we can provide dynamic values,yml file with new buildt image everytime we trigger the pipeline.

1.3 we need condfigure the gitlab-ci.yml file to authorize agent to our k8s cluster, so we can run the kubectl commands udner script:, in this way we can deploy our app in the simple way.

Here for this to be succesful, we need gitlab runner to be authorized to access k8s cluster, we might require some tools like jq to be installed on the runner, we also need kubectl cli to be installed on the runner.

in gitlab-ci file we can define various stages with various environemnts and pass the variables to the gitlab using gitlab variables options located in setting to pass all environemt variables or if we use an vault to store secrets we need to pass the vauolt token to access those environment variables.

Step 2: Using Flux.

2.1 If we want to use Flux we need to deploy flux tool on to our k8s cluster and integrate our gitlab repository with flux.

2.2 flux has its own folder strucutre to work with k8s objects, we can either use helm charts or k8s objects to deploy them on k8s cluster.

2.3 So once our build process is completed we can replace the imafge in our flux repo which will automatically trigger the flux to deploy newly created changes on to the k8s cluster.


This can be more in detial and lots of other factors need to configured to follow any of the above deployment proccesses.
